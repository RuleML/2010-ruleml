<h2>Michael Genesereth, Stanford University, USA</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><em>Logical Spreadsheets</em></span><br /><br />
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Logical spreadsheets are spreadsheets in which formulas are written as logical constraints rather than function definitions.  Allowing logical constraints in spreadsheets substantially increases their utility.  At the same time, it poses interesting technical challenges, notably the representation of logical constraints (both static and dynamic), query and update in the face of data incompleteness and inconsistency, and support for collaborative work on distributed spreadsheets.  In this presentation, we describe logical spreadsheets in detail and offer some approaches to dealing with these underlying challenges. While logical spreadsheet technology is useful in specialized applications, it is even more useful as a general technology for the World Wide Web, turning ordinary Web forms into logical forms (sometimes called websheets).  Moreover, the concept and technology of collaborative websheets can be further generalized to collaborative management of arbitrary logical databases.  We close with thoughts about how this generalized technology can be used to produce a key component of the Semantic Web, viz. a World Data Web in which concepts and relationships replace documents and links, in which rules replace code, and in which query and update replace keyword search and file management.<br /><br />
<strong>About the speaker:</strong> Michael Genesereth is an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. He received his Sc.B. in Physics from M.I.T. and his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University. Genesereth is most known for his work on Computational Logic and applications of that work in Enterprise Management and Electronic Commerce. He is one of the founders of Teknowledge, the premier company commercializing Artificial Intelligence; he is a co-founder of CommerceNet, the premier organization for electronic commerce on the Internet; and he is a founder of Mergent Systems, an early vendor of technology for integrated catalogs on the World-Wide Web. (Mergent was sold to Commerce One in 2000, which in turn was sold to Perfect Commerce in 2006.) Genesereth is the current director of the Logic Group at Stanford and research director of CodeX (the Stanford Center for Computers and Law).<br /><br />

<h2>David Webber, OASIS CAM TC Chair, USA</h2>

<span style="font-size: 15px;"><em>NIEM Canonical XML Dictionaries and Rule Engine Systems</em></span><br /><br />

<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Consistent interoperable government information exchanges using the NIEM.gov approach rely on repeatable and predictable patterns and techniques. This presents a range of challenges to implementers including mapping from domain vocabularies to NIEM and then what rule validation framework to adopt? How can rule engines assist in automating these processes? NIEM has been criticized as being heavy-weight and cumbersome; how can rule-based techniques dramatically simplify the challenges that developers face in exploiting the NIEM-based approach?<br /><br />
<strong>About the speaker:</strong> David is currently working as a consultant to the US Government for eHealthcare applications of XML and ebXML. He is also guiding work on open source public standard-based solutions for eVoting. Previously he worked as VP Business Development for XML Global Technologies Inc, and he is a cofounder of the XML/edi Group. An acknowledged authority on XML and eBusiness David holds two US Patents on advanced information transformation and EDI. Known as a innovator David has been the genesis of a wide range of world leading solutions including airport gate scheduling, buy-repair logistics, address synchronization, SeeMail, iBolt, ShroudIt!, XML Transform and Registry and now VisualScript XML for Smartdraw.com. David is chairing a new OASIS Technical Committee developing Content Assembly Mechanism specifications as a vital component of next generation eBusiness infrastructure. David has also co-authored a book for New Riders Press entitled "ebXML: The New Global Standard for doing business on the Internet", designed for managers, executives and business implementers. He lectures frequently in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, has more than 20 years' experience implementing business systems in a broad spectrum of industries. He is also heavily involved in ebXML interoperability standards development and the latest OASIS Business-Centric Methodology work. Additionally David has continued to focus on facilitating the development and deployment of semantic registry systems by government and industry organizations. He received his degree in Physics with Computing from the University of Kent, Canterbury, UK, in 1976.<br /><a href="http://www.drrw.net/"><br />http://www.drrw.net/</a><br /><br />

<h2>Donald Chapin, Business Semantics Ltd, UK - Co-chair of OMG Business Modeling &amp; Integration DTF</h2>

<span style="font-size: 15px;"><em>Implementing SBVR with a Practitioner's Perspective</em></span><br /><br />

<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Object Management Group's "Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business 
Rules (SBVR)" standard is a synthesis from four disciplines: terminology 
science, natural language grammar structures, formal logic and the practice of 
applying the business rules approach in organizations.  The SBVR specification 
(like all OMG specifications) is directed primarily at tool developers. As a 
result some of SBVR's most important capabilities for practitioners are not 
self-evident from just reading the specification document.  This presentation 
will illustrate how a number of these SBVR features can be implemented in a tool 
to deliver significant value to SBVR users.<br /><br />
<strong>About the speaker:</strong> Donald Chapin has pioneered methods for defining concepts, 
structuring knowledge, and expressing business rules in the language of 
the business since the beginning of his career. Having co-founded a 
manufacturing company with responsibility for its organization, 
processes, management system and recordkeeping, he proceeded to bring 
that business orientation to the design of IBM's first training program 
for business application development. He continues to enable 
organizations to document and manage their business vocabularies, 
policies, rules, services and processes as a strategy, tools and methods
 consultant, workshop facilitator, trainer, mentor, and quality 
reviewer. Donald Chapin has been the chair of the OMG Finalization Task Force 
for the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), 
co-chair of the OMG Business Modeling and Integration Domain Task 
Force, and the OMG Liaison to ISO TC 37 (Terminology and other Language 
and Content Resources).<br /></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 14px;">How To Marry Common Logic with Rules and a Visual Query Builder to RuleML</span></em><br /><em></em></div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The first part of my talk will cover in more detail the Franz prototype implementation of Common Logic with Rules (CLWR). We combine the backward chaining rule mechanism borrowed from Prolog with RDFS++ reasoning and a query interface that borrows some of the good features from Sparql and SQL. We will take you through a series of design decisions that we made with regards to dealing with named graphs, aggregates, explicit and universal quantification, filter expressions, user defined rules and extension mechanisms, built in math and string libraries and insert, update and delete operators. The second part of my talk will be about a new state of the art visual query builder (AVQB) that makes it very straight forward to build Sparql and Prolog queries, and in the near future also CLWR expressions. We imagine that in the future AVQB can also be used to generate RuleML.<br /><br />

<h2>Dumitru Roman, SINTEF ICT, Norway</h2>

<em><span style="font-size: 14px;">Rule-based Composition and Mediation of Environmental Services</span></em><br /><br />

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This demo will introduce a framework for environmental services, emphasizing the use of rules for declarative specification of environmental services composition and mediation. The demo will consist of a presentation of the environmental services framework developed in the context of the SWING (<a href="http://138.232.65.156/swing/">http://138.232.65.156/swing/</a>) and ENVISION (<a href="http://www.envision-project.eu/">http://www.envision-project.eu/</a>) projects (a short video is available at <a href="http://138.232.65.156/swing/showcase.html">http://138.232.65.156/swing/showcase.html</a>), a presentation of the rule-based, declarative modeling of compositions based on the GEECoP tool (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gecop/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gecop/</a>), and a brief presentation of the rule-based FloraMap mediation technique developed in the context of the EMPOWER project (<a href="http://empower-project.eu/">http://empower-project.eu/</a>).<br /><br />
<strong>About the speaker:</strong> Dr. Dumitru Roman joined SINTEF ICT as a research scientist in September 2009. Previously he worked as a senior researcher at the Semantic Technology Institute Innsbruck, Austria, where he was involved in several large projects on developing and applying semantic technologies in the area of service-oriented computing and the Web. His general research background and interests lay at the border between knowledge representation and reasoning, and large scale, dynamically distributed systems.<br /><br />
